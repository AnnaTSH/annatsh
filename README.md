## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anna

I am an Analytics Engineer with a passion for adhering to best practices in **data transformation**, **documentation**, and ensuring **data quality**.

In 2020, I discovered the fascinating world of data engineering and data analysis, and I learned tools such as **dbt**, **Airflow**, and **Tableau**. I was fortunate to be involved in challenging projects that pushed me to extensively use **SQL** and **Python**. 

My student project was really cool: my team used NLP techniques for sentiment analysis, topic classification, and text generation to create a model that writes in the style of a teenager's diary, [sorry, it's in Russian](https://projects.pandan.eusp.org/feelings), but there are cool pictures, though. 

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked for an NGO dedicated to improving policy-making through a scientific approach, where I analysed large volumes of governmental data. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been with a fintech startup leveraging the latest LLMs for transaction data enrichment.
